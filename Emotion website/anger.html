				<p>"ANGER->REVENGE->REGRET"->THE CYCLE OF ANGER</p>
				<p>A lady once came to Billy Sunday and attempted to rationalize her angry outbursts. She said, “There’s nothing wrong with losing my temper. I blow up, and then it’s all over.”
					Mr. Sunday replied, “So does a shotgun, and look at the damage it leaves behind!” </p>

				<p> HOW TO TREAT YOUR SIBLINGS</P>
				<P> A Sunday school teacher was discussing the Ten Commandments with her five and six-year-olds. After explaining the commandment to honor thy Father and thy Mother, she asked, “Is there a commandment that teaches us how to treat our brothers and sisters?

			<summary>DEALING WITH ANGER </summary>
			<p>First up, anger isn’t a ‘bad’ emotion. It can actually help you to be honest or to stand up for something you believe in. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with feeling angry. What matters is how you cope with and express your anger.</p>
			<p>We’re not guaranteeing you won’t still be in a bad mood, but you’ll be less likely to act in a way you might regret.
					Here are our tips for dealing with anger.</p>
			<p>1. Recognise the warning signs</p><br>
			<p>If you can recognise when you’re starting to feel angry, you’ll be in a good place to try some of our tips before you get really worked up or lash out. You can then try a few of the strategies below. Some warning signs are:
				<br>
				+pounding heart<br>
				+gritting your teeth<br>
				+sweating<br>
				+tight chest<br>
				+shaking<br>
				+anxiety<br>
				+raising your voice<br>
				+being snappy or defensive<br>
				+temporarily losing your sense of humour<br>
				+pacing<br>
				+getting a ‘flash’ of a bad mood<br>
				+being overly critical of someone<br>
				+feeling argumentative.<br>
			<p>2. Work out why you’re angry<p/>
			<p>	There’s lots of reasons why you might be angry. It’s a normal or understandable response in some situations, such as when you or someone else is being treated unfairly. If you’re not sure why you’ve just snapped at someone, though, think back through your day and try to pinpoint what set you off.

				Some other reasons why you might be feeling angry include:

				you’re under a lot of pressure<br>
				you’re experiencing bodily or hormonal changes that cause mood swings<br>
				you’re frustrated with how your life is going.<br>
				If you work on first recognising and then dealing with your anger, it won’t have such a damaging effect on your relationships, body, mind and emotions.<br></p>
			<p>3. Write it down</p>
			<p>	Sometimes, writing stuff down can help you work out why you’re feeling angry and how you might be able to deal with it. It’ll also help you to put things in perspective.</p>
				
			<p>	4. Count to 100</p>
			<p>	This one seems pretty basic, but it works. Thinking about something other than what’s making you upset for 100 seconds can help you avoid blowing a fuse. It gives you a chance to gather yourself and your thoughts before you do anything else.

			<p>	5. Press pause</p>
			<p>	When you feel angry about something, it’s almost impossible to deal with the situation in a productive or helpful way. If you feel yourself losing your cool, just walk away from the situation for a while. You’ll deal with it better when everyone, yourself included, is feeling calmer.</p>

			<p>	6. Move your body</p>
			<p>	Exercise is an awesome way to let off steam. You could take a walk around the block, go for a run, or do something really high-energy like boxing.
				exercise your frustration away</p>

			<p>	7. Talk to someone</p>
			<p>	Talking to someone you trust about how you’re feeling can take a weight off your shoulders as well as your mind. That could be a trusted adult, friend or family member. You could even give the ReachOut forums a go, and talk with other young people who get how you’re feeling.
				If your anger is getting out of control, consider seeing a mental health professional. Watch our video to find out why talking helps.</p>

			<p>	8. Take time to relax</p>
			<p>	If you know what helps you to relax, you’ll find it really useful whenever you’re feeling angry. Take some time out to do something you enjoy, whether that’s walking in the park, reading a book or listening to music. You could also try an app like ReachOut Breathe or Headspace to help you relax.
