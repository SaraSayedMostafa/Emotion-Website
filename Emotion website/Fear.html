		<h1>Fear</h1>

                  ― Robin Sharma  </p>

			<summary>HADITH</summary>
				<p>This is one which the Prophet (sall Allāhu ʿalayhi wa sallam) taught Abū Bakr. Abū Bakr asked,<br>‘O messenger of Allāh, what should I say in the morning and evening?’ He said,<br>“O Allāh, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, Lord of everything and its owner. I testify that there is no god but You. I seek refuge with You from the evil of myself and the evil of Shayṭān and his encouragement to associate others with You, and that I just commit an evil against myself or be its cause for another Muslim.”
				<p>We notice two things here:

					(1) The Prophet (sall Allāhu ʿalayhi wa sallam) chooses these words for Abū Bakr. He is the most pious human being after the prophets and yet he is taught to ask Allāh for refuge from Shayṭān’s whisperings and the evil of his own self.

					(2) The Prophet (sall Allāhu ʿalayhi wa sallam) teaches us to ask for protection from both the internal and external enemy which are, as Imām Ibnul Qayyim described,</p>
				        “The two originating sources of all evil; One’s self and Shayṭān.”</p>

			<summary>SHORT STORY</summary>
				<p>"Fear is everything "</p><br>
				<p>	The moon’s crisp, clean, pure light seeps through a poorly drawn curtain, bouncing its self off an amassed collection of action figures lined up on display. It slithers over the room’s hero themed wallpaper and creates the shadows the room’s owner fears. Looking out from his quilt fortress Charlie sees faces screaming from his wardrobes grainy, varnished wooden panels. Throwing his quilt over him he holds onto his lucky charm hanging around his neck.

					“It’s all in my head; they’re not real. It’s just the way the tree was grown.” He tells himself, convincing his mind that there is nothing scary in his room.

					“Come now Charlie, we’ve talked about this. Why would you want me in your head?” A deep but soothing voice says. Trembling, Charlie looks out from under his quilt convinced that the voice is made up by his mind. He sees nothing; just the moonlight doing what light does best, destroying darkness.

					“You’re in my head, you’re not real.”

					“But if I’m in your head, I’m with wherever you go; why not believe what I tell you, I’m beneath you.”

					Looking around the room for the source of the voice, Charlie is still unable to see anything.

					“You know where I am, all you need to do is look.”

					Charlie feels his eyes move of their own accord, staring down next to his bed, his mind telling him in a moment of weakness. Just, one, quick, peek. A static shock from his charm races through his hand knocking him out of that train of thought. “No, you can’t get me when I’m on here.” His heart pounds against his chest like a sledgehammer with sweat running off his forehead like fresh morning dew.

					“Do you know what I am?”

					“A monster.”

					“Of sorts, I’m everything you fear. And you, fear; everything.” Laying flat on his bed looking at the calming patterns on his ceiling, believing. I’m dreaming, this is all a bad dream. I want to wake up now. The voice continues: “I am those faces you see in that wardrobe, I am the shadows in all dark places, I am the spiders hunting from the corners of your walls and the rats that feast under your house.”

					“That doesn’t make you real.” Charlie states whilst closing his eyes as tightly as possible.

					Replied to only by silence, Charlie cautiously peeks through the minuscule gap between his eyelids. The rising moon lights up more of his surroundings showing him he is truly alone, the faces on the wardrobe and the shadows fade back away to where they belong. I knew it. Wrapping himself up in his warm quilt, relieved that he beat his mind at its own game.

					A weak chill wraps around his leg, seeping into the quilt and duvet.

					“Then what does make me real? Does this?”

					The weak chill around Charlie’s leg turns ice cold with a freezing grip, squeezing him tightly. Flailing his leg around uncontrollably, panic stricken to his core, the freezing feeling spreads deeper into his leg through muscle and tissue, touching his bone. He tries to cry out for help but the words get caught in his throat. He is too scared to force them out. With a final kick of his leg, the chilling grip is gone. He is free.

					Cautiously looking down at his bed, his eyes see a thin, bony shadow hand slither like a snake off the edge of his mattress, curling around back underneath him. He dives back under his quilt squeezing his lucky charm, closing his eyes and whispering over and over again: “It’s not real, that wasn’t real. It’s all in my head, its all in my head.”

					When he opens his eyes the darkness has been vanquished by the dawning sun, its light destroying any remnants of the night. After a couple of moments wondering what’s going on he throws his quilt off him in a panic stricken daze, franticly rolling up his pyjamas to see his leg. Charlie’s eyes quiver with disbelief – not at what his eyes are telling him, but what his body is feeling. There are no marks on his leg, even though his body is telling him it remembers being grabbed.  Charlie runs his hand over his leg; it’s freezing to the touch but his body doesn’t acknowledge this change in temperature.

					Was it all a dream? Or did that really happen?

					With a feeling of security owed to the presence of the sun, Charlie shifts his body around, positioning himself at the edge of his bed prepared to lean over. Lowering himself down, gripping onto the edge of his bed he tells himself one final time. “It’s all in my head.”

					“No; It’s not, Charlie.”</p>

					How does fear start? <br>
					When we are so small, <br>
					Fear of being alone, <br>
					With our cries we call.<br>

					Then comes further fear, <br>
					Fear of things we can't see, <br>
					Fear of the dark, <br>
					“Please don’t leave me.”<br>

					Then comes more fear,<br> 
					Fear of unacceptance, <br>
					Do they want to be my friend?<br> 
					Will this fear ever end? <br>

			<summary>ACING YOUR FEAR</summary>
			<p>
			 
				My patient *Doreen suffered one of the worst traumas imaginable—her twin sister committed suicide. Fourteen months later another tragedy occurred: *Beth, a cousin to whom Doreen had once been extremely close, jumped off a bridge to her death. Doreen dreaded—and feared—the mourning process. She was afraid of losing herself to overwhelming grief. Instead of dealing with her emotions, she found what felt like the perfect coping mechanism: non-stop solo travel to the far corners of the globe. During her rare periods at home, she felt lonely, but found numerous reasons to not attempt forging friendships.

				After one particularly adventurous trip, she slumped into my office. “Sherry, I hiked in the Amazon and had a session with a shaman and yet it felt so hollow. I wanted to share the experience with someone…with Beth.”

				Doreen’s distress convinced her that it was time to stay home for a few months (her bank account would thank her!) and devote herself to what she feared most: facing herself.

				I suggested she might make new connections through a social networking website called meetup. A few times she registered for an activity, but at the last minute experienced anxiety symptoms so intolerable that she stayed home.

				During one session, I asked, “Why does letting someone become close scare you so much?”

				She closed her eyes and after a few minutes’ of contemplation said, “If I let myself be vulnerable, it will kill me when the person leaves.”

				“Why do you assume the person will leave?”

				“My sister and Beth left—everyone does.”

				“And yet here you are still standing. You survived the worst that could happen. How could attending a pottery painting event be harder?”

				The next day she registered for a group hiking event. At our next session she confessed the morning of the hike she experienced such severe anxiety symptoms —sweating palms, shaking lips, heart palpitations—so uncomfortable, she almost didn’t go.  “I told myself, ‘Sherry says fear is a momentary emotion. If I run from it I’ll feel worse later.’”

				She had such a fabulous time on the hike she impulsively volunteered to arrange the group’s next outing. Doreen recalled, “As soon as I got home I got so anxious that I reached for the phone to rescind my offer but I made myself breathe and continued to go about my day.”

				Soon Doreen had an active social life for the first time in years. Yes, she still experienced anxiety, but now she had coping mechanisms that allowed her to find relief and overcome the anxiety. “I’m still really afraid of losing people, but I’m more afraid of ultimately never finding what I really crave—community.”


				Tips to Work Through Your Fear and Live Your Life
				If you are experiencing overwhelming fear or anxiety, especially a phobia, please consider working with a therapist. Additionally, here are some suggestions that have helped many of my patients work through being hostage to their own fears:

				Allow yourself to sit with your fear for 2-3 minutes at a time. Breathe with it and say, “It’s okay. It feels lousy but emotions are like the ocean—the waves ebb and flow.” Have something nurturing planned immediately after your 2-3 minute sitting period is completed: Call the good friend waiting to hear from you; immerse yourself in an activity you know is enjoyable and engrossing.
				Write down the things you are grateful for. Look at the list when you feel you’re in a bad place. Add to the list.
				Remind yourself that your anxiety is a storehouse of wisdom. Write a letter, “Dear Anxiety, I am no longer intimidated by you. What can you teach me?”
				Exercise. Exercise can refocus you (your mind can only focus on one thing at a time). Whether you go on a short walk, head to a boxing gym for an all-out sweat session, or turn on a 15-minute yoga video at home, exercise is good for you and it will ground you and help you feel more capable.
				Use humor to deflate your worst fears. For instance, what are some ridiculous worst-case scenarios that might happen if you accept an invitation to deliver a speech to a crowd of 500 people? I might pee in my pants at the podium  *** I will be arrested for giving the worst speech in history *** My first boyfriend (girlfriend) will be in the audience and heckle me.
				Appreciate your courage. Doreen would tell herself during difficult times, “Every time I don’t allow fear to keep me from doing something that scares me, I am making myself stronger and less likely to let the next fear attack stop me.”
				Perhaps the most important coping tool is to be kind to yourself. What advice would you give to a best friend about those negative inner voices that whisper: Be afraid. Don’t try anything new?  Do as you advise others—don’t listen to the negativity; be your own best friend.

				Developing self-compassion isn’t always easy. A compassionate counselor can help without judging you for any mistakes you may have made in the past. Therapy can help you find support and healing for all types of hatred.
