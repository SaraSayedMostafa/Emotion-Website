				<p>Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was travelling along the path leading to Mecca that he happened to pass by a mountain called Jumdan. He said: Proceed on, it is Jumdan, Mufarradun have gone ahead. They (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said: Allah's Messenger, who are Mufarradun? He said: They are those males and females who remember Allah much.</p>

			<summary>SHORT STORY</summary>
				<p>"LONLINESS"</p><br>
				<p>I’m in my element when being a social butterfly.

					Thinking back to the times that have been the most special, the most exhilarating and the most damn fun, they’re the times when I’ve been bouncing around a room full of good people, just doing what I do best.

					Laughter matters to me.  Being silly matters to me.  Being with good people matters to me.

					So how did it happen that I’m at a place in life where I spent Christmas Eve, New Year’s Eve, my Birthday (and a lot of other days to boot) alone for the last few years?

					How did I get to a place where I can go days where the only conversation is between me and my barista?

					How did I get to be more alone than ever?

					It happened because unwanted change happens incrementally.

					The true cost of my decisions has crept up on me over the last 5 years, and I’m not liking what I’m seeing.
					I have a chronic illness which means I need to rest a lot.  I only have so much energy available to me, and once that’s been spent my illness bites harder than a predatory pitbull at a penguin picnic.

					My illness regularly floors me like a spade in the face.

					So to manage this I started saying “No” to things.

					Like going out after work with colleagues because I know it’ll hit me hard a day or two later.

					To going out on weekends because it means I won’t be able to get up and get things done on Sunday and won’t be ready to start another week.
					I’ve noticed the lack of human contact impacting my energy levels, my enthusiasm about things and even how I perceive my own feelings.

					The whole thing alarms me and disappoints me, and all of this is potentially more damaging than anything I could set out to do intentionally.

					Unwanted change happens incrementally, is only observable over distance and is not benign.

					Don’t get me wrong, I have so much to be grateful for and I love so much in life.  I’m fortunate to know some truly extraordinary people; I’m lucky that I have a fantastic family who I love dearly; I love that through my illness I’m discovering some of life’s most valuable secrets.

					I’m lucky, and I’m grateful.

					But I also know that this incremental change will continue unless I find a way to get off the remote island I’m living on.

					Staying still won’t stop the waters from rising, and by “keeping on keeping on” the change that’s been imperceptibly underway these last 5 years will continue unchecked.

					I know that an isolated life is not the kind of life I crave or need, and I honestly don’t know what the road ahead looks like or if I can even stay on it.

					All I know is this.

					When the path you’ve been on has been necessary, but the place it’s taken you to is undesired and unsustainable, you have to open to it.

					You gotta embrace where you are.  You gotta open to what’s already here.  You gotta love the place you’re in first.

					This is how I get to make new, better decisions based on the best of me rather than the small, embittered man I could become.

					This is how I’m starting.

					Want to come with me?

				How to Deal with Loneliness
				We’ve all been there—you are not alone. 

				If you are a human in this world, chances are you have felt left out from time to time. Maybe you did not land an invite to a party of the year.  Or, maybe your pals forgot to invite you to lunch. Or, maybe you just have yet to find the people who make you tick. Feeling lonely because you are isolated from time to time is not uncommon. For some people, though, the feeling of loneliness persists without respite. When the feeling of loneliness continues for days, weeks, or even months, it can be seriously damaging to your mental health.  

				Signs of Loneliness
				When a feeling of being alone and disconnected persists for extended periods of time (often despite actually surrounding yourself with other humans), quality, rejuvenating alone time transitions into crippling loneliness. Persistent loneliness can lead to:

				Low energy or brain fog

				Sleep problems (including difficulty with falling asleep or problems staying 

				Lack of interest in food

				Drinking more or using drugs 

				Feeling hopeless, worthless, or increased feelings of depression

				Increased feelings of anxiety

				Getting sick more often

				Physical aches and pains including headaches, migraines, stomach aches, or muscle tension

				Excess shopping or increased attachment to material things

				Binge-watching television

				Crisis Text Line can help you deal with loneliness. If you or someone you know is struggling, text a Crisis Counselor at 741741. Use the mobile text button below to text from your phone. 

				Types of Loneliness
				If you’re feeling lonely, chances are you are actually not alone in that feeling. In fact, loneliness is so common that researchers have classified the feeling into three main categories:

				Situational Loneliness— Maybe you started a new school, moved away from your friends and family, or just have a new schedule that is making it hard for you to connect with the people and places that used to fill your life. Situational loneliness occurs when there are changes in your life that cause you to feel isolated. Thankfully, this loneliness often gets better with time as you adapt to your new normal.

				Developmental Loneliness— It feels like everyone else is moving and shaking without you: acing tests, getting promotions, or starting families. Sometimes, this feeling of being behind—of feeling like everyone is moving on and excelling without you—can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. 

				Internal Loneliness— You’re out with your friends hitting up your favorite pizza joint. Instead of feeling surrounded by the people you love, you can’t shake the feeling of being totally and utterly alone. Sometimes, people feel lonely when they are actually hardly alone at all. Internal loneliness comes from a perception of being alone in any and every situation. 



				Causes of Loneliness
				Maybe you’re experiencing a big change in your life. Or, maybe the friends you used to connect with do not seem to “get” you anymore. Or, maybe you are having trouble finding someone to confide in. There are so many reasons you could be feeling lonely. If you are unable to pinpoint how and why you are experiencing loneliness, think back on if any of these events happened in our life recently:

				You moved away from close friends or family

				You lost a friend or loved one

				You made the switch to living alone after living with family/roommates

				You’re having difficulties with meeting new people due to access issues

				You have been in poor physical or mental health

				You have avoided social situations because you fear being rejected

				You have recently retired, quit your job, or lost your job

				You have to live in a country where they don’t speak your native language or you are experiencing another form of culture shock

				You live in an area that is geographically cut-off from the rest of the world

				You have been spending an inordinate amount of time on social media 



				How to Deal with Loneliness
				We’re here for you if you are feeling lonely. Text 741741 if you need to talk with someone. You can also try:

				Reach out to friends and family: in this modern world, there are so many ways you can connect with the people who mean the most to you. Don’t live in the same city? Try shooting the special people in your life a text message just to let them know they’re on your mind. Here’s a start: “Hey, I’ve been missing you lately. How are you?”

				Get out there and say “hello”: Start interacting with the people you see in your daily life. Maybe the barista at your local coffee shop who makes you the perfect cup of joe every single day. Or, maybe it’s the crossing guard who keeps you safe on your way to school or work. Studies show that being kind towards others can actually make you happier. So, next time you get the perfect cup of coffee or make it safely to your next destination, make sure you say please and thank you. And, if you’re feeling spicy, maybe even ask their name. There you have it: a new friend.

				Find your people: Studies show that finding a community connection can be pivotal for mental wellness. These days, there’s a group for anything. Try a new workout class, start a Quizbowl league, or make a standing brunch date with people you want to prioritize in your life. Not sure who your people are or where to find them? Try Meetup.com to find people with similar interests in your area. 

				Get a pet: According to science, pets could be beneficial for your mental wellness, decreasing stress and mitigating symptoms of anxiety. Use your furry pal as an opportunity to meet other pet owners by hitting up a cat café or dog park. Spending time with your pet and meeting other people—a loneliness-combatting double whammy.
